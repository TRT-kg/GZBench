            "original_question": "Doctors are scientists who operate in a world of statistics, odds and probability. Yet they've long been taught that when dealing with patients they should convey a reassuring level of confidence and certainty. _____, patients expect their doctors to give them a clear diagnosis and a straightforward course of treatment. But now that information about every medical condition imaginable is just a few clicks away, experts are asking whether doctors’ apparent ____ when communicating with their patients actually does more harm than good. With the information overload brought by the progress of medicine and technology answers are ____ black or white.\n\nMedical schools are only just starting to teach doctors how to deal with this, and patients’ expectations haven’t ____ either.\n\n\"Medicine has always fallen short of the sort of certainty that we find in math and geometry\", says Dr. Ross Upshur, a researcher at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health in Toronto. \"If you think about knowledge and what it does, it’s about ____ uncertainty, not about creating certainty.\"\n\nDoctors in training, like gamblers, need to be ____ working in a field in which they’re constantly weighing the odds based on a myriad of factors. When Upshur teaches medical students how to diagnose an ailment, he tells them to ____ their inquiry — come up with a list of possibilities, rather than quickly home in on a single solution. \"Even when you make a diagnosis that you think is firm, you usually don’t have certainty about what would be the best ____ and what the outcomes will be in the long run.\"\n\nTechnology has helped ____ the quest for certainty. We are reaching a point where we can feed a list of symptoms into a computer and get a more ____ diagnosis than from a doctor. Dr. Richard Schwartzstein, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, sees such developments as both a/an ____ and an opportunity. On one hand, he says, \"technology tries to push you to a/an ____ level of certainty. Do this test to get a 99 percent level of certainty that you have this disease.\"\n\nOn the other hand, computers can’t ____ a diagnosis or a treatment to patients in a comforting way. Take a routine screening test for early-stage lung cancer. Based on your age, your smoking status, and your gender, a computer can do a great job of evaluating the chances of finding a cancerous nodule. It can also ____ quite precisely the risk of developing an actual cancer based on the size and shape of a nodule.

            "original_question": "Doctors are scientists who operate in a world of statistics, odds and probability. Yet they've long been taught that when dealing with patients they should convey a reassuring level of confidence and certainty. _____, patients expect their doctors to give them a clear diagnosis and a straightforward course of treatment. But now that information about every medical condition imaginable is just a few clicks away, experts are asking whether doctors’ apparent ____ when communicating with their patients actually does more harm than good. With the information overload brought by the progress of medicine and technology answers are ____ black or white.\n\nMedical schools are only just starting to teach doctors how to deal with this, and patients’ expectations haven’t ____ either.\n\n\"Medicine has always fallen short of the sort of certainty that we find in math and geometry\", says Dr. Ross Upshur, a researcher at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health in Toronto. \"If you think about knowledge and what it does, it’s about ____ uncertainty, not about creating certainty.\"\n\nDoctors in training, like gamblers, need to be ____ working in a field in which they’re constantly weighing the odds based on a myriad of factors. When Upshur teaches medical students how to diagnose an ailment, he tells them to ____ their inquiry — come up with a list of possibilities, rather than quickly home in on a single solution. \"Even when you make a diagnosis that you think is firm, you usually don’t have certainty about what would be the best ____ and what the outcomes will be in the long run.\"\n\nTechnology has helped ____ the quest for certainty. We are reaching a point where we can feed a list of symptoms into a computer and get a more ____ diagnosis than from a doctor. Dr. Richard Schwartzstein, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, sees such developments as both a/an ____ and an opportunity. On one hand, he says, \"technology tries to push you to a/an ____ level of certainty. Do this test to get a 99 percent level of certainty that you have this disease.\"\n\nOn the other hand, computers can’t ____ a diagnosis or a treatment to patients in a comforting way. Take a routine screening test for early-stage lung cancer. Based on your age, your smoking status, and your gender, a computer can do a great job of evaluating the chances of finding a cancerous nodule. It can also ____ quite precisely the risk of developing an actual cancer based on the size and shape of a nodule.

With the information overload brought by the progress of medicine and technology answers are ____ black or white.\n\nMedical schools are only just starting to teach doctors how to deal with this, and patients’ expectations haven’t ____ either.\n\n\"Medicine has always fallen short of the sort of certainty that we find in math and geometry\", says Dr. Ross Upshur, a researcher at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health in Toronto. \"If you think about knowledge and what it does, it’s about ____ uncertainty, not about creating certainty.\"\n\nDoctors in training, like gamblers, need to be ____ working in a field in which they’re constantly weighing the odds based on a myriad of factors. When Upshur teaches medical students how to diagnose an ailment, he tells them to ____ their inquiry — come up with a list of possibilities, rather than quickly home in on a single solution. \"Even when you make a diagnosis that you think is firm, you usually don’t have certainty about what would be the best ____ and what the outcomes will be in the long run.\"\n\nTechnology has helped ____ the quest for certainty. We are reaching a point where we can feed a list of symptoms into a computer and get a more ____ diagnosis than from a doctor. Dr. Richard Schwartzstein, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, sees such developments as both a/an ____ and an opportunity. On one hand, he says, \"technology tries to push you to a/an ____ level of certainty. Do this test to get a 99 percent level of certainty that you have this disease.\"\n\nOn the other hand, computers can’t ____ a diagnosis or a treatment to patients in a comforting way. Take a routine screening test for early-stage lung cancer. Based on your age, your smoking status, and your gender, a computer can do a great job of evaluating the chances of finding a cancerous nodule. It can also ____ quite precisely the risk of developing an actual cancer based on the size and shape of a nodule. What it can’t do, ____ is decide how to break the news that you have a nodule in your lung that has a 1 percent chance of becoming a cancer.\n请你回答第请你回答第55小题小题\n   - A. therefore\n   - B. though\n   - C. instead\n   - D. otherwise",

            "original_question": "In my ninth-grade writing class last year, I met a cowboy who saved his town, a strict father who demanded his son earn straight A's, and a modern-day Juliet who died of heartbreak after her parents rejected the love of her young life. More than once, I found myself wondering just how my students, who'd created these people, knew their subjects so well.\nBut things were different for their first essay, which was about the question: 'Why is writing important?' Most of the essays filled less than one page, and few contained a sentence that could be interpreted as a thesis statement. I was shocked. Then I realized that the problem was the question itself. They could have written pages on the necessity of computers, but writing, in and of itself, simply didn't strike them as important. This would have to change.\nAs a new unit started, I asked everyone to write a persuasive piece on a health-related topic of their choice. This time they found the exercise much more interesting. For the next two assignments, a personal-narrative unit followed by a creative-writing workshop, I only required that the piece meet the specifications of its genre and that it contain a thesis. The results were staggering. The students took on diverse topics and turned in stories, 10 to 20 pages each, with characters that broadened my view and touched my heart.\nI walked into class believing that writing is important as a means of communication. However, my students demonstrated something more important to me. When the final bell rang in June, I walked away with a yearbook full of messages about writing's most powerful significance — the ability to connect people, to put us in another's skin, to teach us what it means to be human.\n请你回答第What does the underlined word 'staggering' in paragraph 3 mean?小题\n   - A.

                "content": "Not too long ago, on a cold winter night, there was a teenager who wanted more screen time and a parent who said no. The teenager was advocating for her right to scroll (翻屏) for an extra 30 minutes. The parent argued that none of her friends’ parents let them have screens after 9 o’clock. “I thought, in this family, we don’t compare ourselves with other people, Dad?” the teenager replied. The parent — who was me, by the way — just got served. Since they were young, I have told my kids not to compare themselves with other people. I have argued countless times that comparisons are the “thief of joy”. Although my daughter didn’t win, she did help expose one of the worst pieces of advice I have ever given. In my defence, I did what we’ve all done before, which is repeat received wisdom without exploring the nuances. But now is the time to set the record straight, which starts with questioning the idea that all social comparison is unhealthy. Social comparisons do, of course, often get us into emotional trouble. But they can be harnessed (利用) for our betterment if we understand how they work. The social comparisons we make — ones that lead us to feel good or bad about ourselves — are vital to our ability to thrive (成长). Science provides a guide we can use to harness the way we perform these comparisons to reduce their negative emotional impacts. Comparing yourself with someone who is outperforming you could result in feelings of envy if you focus on the things they have and you don’t, or it can be energizing and inspiring if you use these comparisons as a source of motivation, for example, “If they can achieve that, so can I.” Comparing yourself with someone who is doing worse than you could result in fear and worry if you think about how you could fall into similar circumstances, or it can draw out feelings of gratitude and appreciation if you use that comparison to broaden your views — for example, “Wow, things could be much worse; I’m doing great.” What I wish I taught my daughter earlier are these nuances. How we feel about ourselves rests not just on whom we compare ourselves with but also on how we think about that comparison. That’s something we all have control over.\n请你回答第 How did the author feel about his daughter’s argument? 小题\n   - A. Excited.\n   - B. Inspired. \n   - C. Energized. \n   - D.

            "original_question": "Not too long ago, on a cold winter night, there was a teenager who wanted more screen time and a parent who said no. The teenager was advocating for her right to scroll (翻屏) for an extra 30 minutes. The parent argued that none of her friends’ parents let them have screens after 9 o’clock. “I thought, in this family, we don’t compare ourselves with other people, Dad?” the teenager replied. The parent — who was me, by the way — just got served. Since they were young, I have told my kids not to compare themselves with other people. I have argued countless times that comparisons are the “thief of joy”. Although my daughter didn’t win, she did help expose one of the worst pieces of advice I have ever given. In my defence, I did what we’ve all done before, which is repeat received wisdom without exploring the nuances. But now is the time to set the record straight, which starts with questioning the idea that all social comparison is unhealthy. Social comparisons do, of course, often get us into emotional trouble. But they can be harnessed (利用) for our betterment if we understand how they work. The social comparisons we make — ones that lead us to feel good or bad about ourselves — are vital to our ability to thrive (成长). Science provides a guide we can use to harness the way we perform these comparisons to reduce their negative emotional impacts. Comparing yourself with someone who is outperforming you could result in feelings of envy if you focus on the things they have and you don’t, or it can be energizing and inspiring if you use these comparisons as a source of motivation, for example, “If they can achieve that, so can I.” Comparing yourself with someone who is doing worse than you could result in fear and worry if you think about how you could fall into similar circumstances, or it can draw out feelings of gratitude and appreciation if you use that comparison to broaden your views — for example, “Wow, things could be much worse; I’m doing great.” What I wish I taught my daughter earlier are these nuances. How we feel about ourselves rests not just on whom we compare ourselves with but also on how we think about that comparison.

Considering the stories we tell about ourselves can help us to change our minds for better. For many years, psychologists saw identity as a combination of someone’s values, beliefs, goals and social roles. Then, in the 1980s, Bob Johnson created the life story model of identity, in which he proposes that, as we go through life, these core features are built in with our memories to create a personal story through which we understand our lives. Our life story is something that starts coming together in our teenage years, when we begin to organise our lives into chapters around key events or life changes, and begin to see ourselves as both the central character and, to a varying extent, the story’s author. People with more consistent stories tend to have a stronger sense of identity, and they feel their life has more meaning, direction and sense of purpose. Such people show greater overall life satisfaction, too. Johnson has also investigated the link between well-being and certain story themes. He discovered that whether someone describes having had some control over events in their past is an important predictor of a person’s mental health. Another key theme involves finding some kind of positive meaning after stressful events. “People could talk about gaining knowledge or personal growth,” says Johnson. His research shows that this is often missing for people with mental health conditions. The good news is that there is evidence we can learn to change our own story. Lisa Green, another researcher, sounds a few notes of caution (谨慎). For instance, hearing about the power of redemptive (拯救性的) stories, many people may feel forced to find a positive angle on horrible events. She saysthat Western culture already pushes people to look for the silver lining behind every cloud. If you want to turn over a new leaf, though, one top tip is that it helps to choose a significant date that signals the start of a new “chapter”.

Considering the stories we tell about ourselves can help us to change our minds for better. For many years, psychologists saw identity as a combination of someone’s values, beliefs, goals and social roles. Then, in the 1980s, Bob Johnson created the life story model of identity, in which he proposes that, as we go through life, these core features are built in with our memories to create a personal story through which we understand our lives. Our life story is something that starts coming together in our teenage years, when we begin to organise our lives into chapters around key events or life changes, and begin to see ourselves as both the central character and, to a varying extent, the story’s author. People with more consistent stories tend to have a stronger sense of identity, and they feel their life has more meaning, direction and sense of purpose. Such people show greater overall life satisfaction, too. Johnson has also investigated the link between well-being and certain story themes. He discovered that whether someone describes having had some control over events in their past is an important predictor of a person’s mental health. Another key theme involves finding some kind of positive meaning after stressful events. “People could talk about gaining knowledge or personal growth,” says Johnson. His research shows that this is often missing for people with mental health conditions. The good news is that there is evidence we can learn to change our own story. Lisa Green, another researcher, sounds a few notes of caution (谨慎). For instance, hearing about the power of redemptive (拯救性的) stories, many people may feel forced to find a positive angle on horrible events. She saysthat Western culture already pushes people to look for the silver lining behind every cloud. If you want to turn over a new leaf, though, one top tip is that it helps to choose a significant date that signals the start of a new “chapter”. Contrary to popular doubt, resolutions made on I January are more effective for this reason. So, whether your goal is saving money or getting fit, there is no better time to become the author of our own destiny (命运).\n请你回答第 What is the passage mainly about?  小题\n   - A.

                "content": "All animals take in oxygen from the air they breathe in, and release CO₂ from their blood when breathing out. Most mammals ( 哺乳动物 ) can’t directly detect oxygen levels in the blood supplied to their tissues. Instead, they rely on the rising level of CO₂ in their blood to signal that they might need to take a breath. But a recent study published in Science suggests seals ( 海豹 ) can sense the amount of oxygen in the blood, and change their diving behavior in response.\nTo find out if oxygen levels affected seal behavior, Professor McKnight at the University of St. Andrews and his colleagues created a special section in a pool where young seals were held. In one corner, there was a breathing chamber ( 呼吸室 ), where they were sheltered from the rain and the wind.\nThe breathing chamber was surrounded by panels that prevented surface swimming, yet swimming below the surface for about 200 feet would give the seals access to a feeder where they could eat as much fish as they liked. Once the seals got familiar with the setup, the researchers started to gradually change the composition of the air in the breathing chamber, increasing or reducing the levels of oxygen and CO₂ to see an effect on their behavior. Sure enough: the higher the level of oxygen, the longer the seals stayed at the feeder.\nThe finding suggests that seals don’t just physically respond to oxygen levels by changing their heart rate or breathing, but that they are sufficiently aware of them to change their behavior. This ability would put seals in a class beyond any land mammals that have been tested.

                "content": "Science serves as a powerful tool for unlocking the mysteries of the universe, but understanding its limitations is essential for its effective application. There are occasions where I have used the handle of a knife as a hammer ( 锤子 ), but the result would have been better if I’d had a more suitable tool at hand. As far as science goes, it is really good at testing things that are testable, but not so for those that are not.\nWe can do, and have done, an impressive amount with our brains. But there are limits. Sometimes these limits go away if we keep at it for long enough — we just need better facilities and experiments to get the answer. Breaking new ground in modern science this way can be costly. Next-generation supercomputers or incredibly large telescopes are expensive, yet these may be required to find answers to some of the unsolved mysteries of the universe.\nSometimes the limits we encounter in trying to unlock the nature of the universe are cognitive ( 认知的 ). Think about this: human DNA is only about 1.2 percent different from that of chimps ( 黑猩猩 ). Chimps are smart, no question. But could you teach them advanced mathematics? What if our DNA were another 1.2 percent further evolved than it is? What might our brains be capable of then? The level of abstract thinking might be unimaginable.\nSometimes the limits we hit are fundamental. There are laws of nature we may never be able to understand, however advanced our brains might become. There are experiments we might never be able to perform. We may never be able to test what caused the universe to be created, and what caused the cause of the universe being created. This is where science may never break through.\nFor something to be considered scientific, it must, by definition, be testable. There is a problem here: it may not need to be testable right now, but it must be testable at some point in the future by experiment. If an idea is untestable, that doesn’t mean it is wrong. It means it is untestable for now. These untestable ideas also happen to be some of the most interesting ones, probably because they’ve puzzled humanity for centuries.\n请你回答第Why does the author mention “knife” and “hammer” in Paragraph 1?小题\n   - A. To demonstrate how tools can be used creatively.\n   - B. To highlight consequences of using a wrong tool.\n   - C. To show the necessity of keeping a handy tool within reach.\n   - D.

                "content": "In the 1980s, I lived in a Victorian triplex close to Ottawa's Chinatown. My days were spent hunched over an Ikea desk, reading, taking notes and writing for a master's degree. Mostly. I persevered through all distractions, fully absorbed in what I was learning. But on warm summer days, I would bring my notecards to Dundonald Park. It was there that I first encountered tai chi.\nMen and women would gather, in loose formation, and begin to move with slow thoughtful deliberation, in unison. Their actions combined to achieve a meditative dance, and it soothed me just to watch. There was a beauty and grace to their sessions that resembled a time-lapse video of a water lily opening.\nTai chi was mesmerizing but I couldn't see its point. I could achieve my fitness goals from exercise classes, swimming and cycling-and it didn't seem that moving so slowly would do much to tone muscle, my Jane Fonda-inspired objective for all activity. I chose only to admire this martial art as it was practiced by others, and kept my distance.\nBut tai chi stayed with me-a seed planted. And amazingly, decades later, the necessary conditions for flowering have emerged. More time-thanks to retirement-coupled with a recommendation from my doctor have brought me full circle, only this time I am not on the park bench watching, but inside the formation, literally stumbling toward growth.\nI had some false starts at the outset. The first group I joined was led by a caring instructor, but its late afternoon timing and its setting-a windowless church basement-left me uninspired. After learning the first eight steps, I took a break and never returned. The second try, six months later, was more successful. I found a morning class in a much brighter space-and the tiny seedling began to push through the soil.\nNaively, I had thought that my goal would be to master the choreography of the 108 movements that form the basis of tai chi. Technically right, but wrong on so many counts. Rather, I quickly learned, what required mastering were my own personality traits.\nThe class was full of lovely people who glided effortlessly, seemingly never confused about where to move next or what the names of the moves were. They assured me that they had been beginners once too, and that I would be able to remember all the moves within three or four years. Three to four years! Graduate degrees took less time.\nBut I could see they were right. After six months, I still found it difficult to complete even the opening 13 moves on my own. I could only watch and copy, watch and copy-waiting for the day that my own body would memorize the internal rhythms of the set.\nThe patience needed for such slow progress was so antithetical to the way I normally approached physical activity that I found it almost unbearable. Previously, any sport that I couldn't do easily, I just rejected. I never did learn how to throw a softball or catch it, or how to do the front crawl. I stuck to activities that needed no honing.\nI also needed to lose the excuses, my favourite strategy for avoidance. Declaring natural clumsiness or bad hips or that I still can't tell left from right instinctively (all true, by the way) just wouldn't fly. Commit and improve: That was the only mantra available.\nOh, and one more thing: I needed to listen-another skill where I lacked proficiency. This realization came to me powerfully in my first master class. I had travelled to a tai chi centre for a two-hour session with a well-known instructor. I was excited and nervous. There were people from all over Canada, and I was a newbie compared to almost everyone there. We began with foundation exercises, and almost immediately, the teacher singled me out for instruction.\nTo be singled out is an honour, but I was mortified. As is required, all the others in the class stopped and turned to watch me (so that they could learn, too) while the instructor corrected my positioning. \"Don't lean back,\" he said, and I repeated the movement. \"Still leaning back,\" he observed laconically, and on it went-probably only for a few minutes, but it seemed an eternity.\nI couldn't say, \"Yeah, I get it.\" I had to show that I did. In those seconds, I concentrated as I had never done before, listening intently to what the instructor was saying, watching his movement and then willing my body to move in imitation. I was simultaneously unlearning and learning, crowding out any self consciousness to focus. As I corrected, my emotion shifted from humiliation to exhilaration. I realized that I was learning not just a new step but a new way of being in the world-truly listening, open to correction, deeply vulnerable.\nI don't know that I will ever master the 108 moves. What I do know is that I have found an activity in my seventh decade where change and growth are not just possible but expected, even when my stubborn personality tendencies re-emerge at every turn.\nGradually, I have become that lily unfolding, awoken not by sunlight and warmth but by this gentle martial art.\n请你回答第20.

            "original_question": "In the 1980s, I lived in a Victorian triplex close to Ottawa's Chinatown. My days were spent hunched over an Ikea desk, reading, taking notes and writing for a master's degree. Mostly. I persevered through all distractions, fully absorbed in what I was learning. But on warm summer days, I would bring my notecards to Dundonald Park. It was there that I first encountered tai chi.\nMen and women would gather, in loose formation, and begin to move with slow thoughtful deliberation, in unison. Their actions combined to achieve a meditative dance, and it soothed me just to watch. There was a beauty and grace to their sessions that resembled a time-lapse video of a water lily opening.\nTai chi was mesmerizing but I couldn't see its point. I could achieve my fitness goals from exercise classes, swimming and cycling-and it didn't seem that moving so slowly would do much to tone muscle, my Jane Fonda-inspired objective for all activity. I chose only to admire this martial art as it was practiced by others, and kept my distance.\nBut tai chi stayed with me-a seed planted. And amazingly, decades later, the necessary conditions for flowering have emerged. More time-thanks to retirement-coupled with a recommendation from my doctor have brought me full circle, only this time I am not on the park bench watching, but inside the formation, literally stumbling toward growth.\nI had some false starts at the outset. The first group I joined was led by a caring instructor, but its late afternoon timing and its setting-a windowless church basement-left me uninspired. After learning the first eight steps, I took a break and never returned. The second try, six months later, was more successful. I found a morning class in a much brighter space-and the tiny seedling began to push through the soil.\nNaively, I had thought that my goal would be to master the choreography of the 108 movements that form the basis of tai chi. Technically right, but wrong on so many counts. Rather, I quickly learned, what required mastering were my own personality traits.\nThe class was full of lovely people who glided effortlessly, seemingly never confused about where to move next or what the names of the moves were. They assured me that they had been beginners once too, and that I would be able to remember all the moves within three or four years. Three to four years! Graduate degrees took less time.\nBut I could see they were right. After six months, I still found it difficult to complete even the opening 13 moves on my own. I could only watch and copy, watch and copy-waiting for the day that my own body would memorize the internal rhythms of the set.\nThe patience needed for such slow progress was so antithetical to the way I normally approached physical activity that I found it almost unbearable. Previously, any sport that I couldn't do easily, I just rejected. I never did learn how to throw a softball or catch it, or how to do the front crawl. I stuck to activities that needed no honing.\nI also needed to lose the excuses, my favourite strategy for avoidance. Declaring natural clumsiness or bad hips or that I still can't tell left from right instinctively (all true, by the way) just wouldn't fly. Commit and improve: That was the only mantra available.\nOh, and one more thing: I needed to listen-another skill where I lacked proficiency. This realization came to me powerfully in my first master class. I had travelled to a tai chi centre for a two-hour session with a well-known instructor. I was excited and nervous. There were people from all over Canada, and I was a newbie compared to almost everyone there. We began with foundation exercises, and almost immediately, the teacher singled me out for instruction.\nTo be singled out is an honour, but I was mortified. As is required, all the others in the class stopped and turned to watch me (so that they could learn, too) while the instructor corrected my positioning. \"Don't lean back,\" he said, and I repeated the movement. \"Still leaning back,\" he observed laconically, and on it went-probably only for a few minutes, but it seemed an eternity.\nI couldn't say, \"Yeah, I get it.\" I had to show that I did. In those seconds, I concentrated as I had never done before, listening intently to what the instructor was saying, watching his movement and then willing my body to move in imitation. I was simultaneously unlearning and learning, crowding out any self consciousness to focus. As I corrected, my emotion shifted from humiliation to exhilaration. I realized that I was learning not just a new step but a new way of being in the world-truly listening, open to correction, deeply vulnerable.\nI don't know that I will ever master the 108 moves. What I do know is that I have found an activity in my seventh decade where change and growth are not just possible but expected, even when my stubborn personality tendencies re-emerge at every turn.\nGradually, I have become that lily unfolding, awoken not by sunlight and warmth but by this gentle martial art.\n请你回答第20.

            "original_question": "In the 1980s, I lived in a Victorian triplex close to Ottawa's Chinatown. My days were spent hunched over an Ikea desk, reading, taking notes and writing for a master's degree. Mostly. I persevered through all distractions, fully absorbed in what I was learning. But on warm summer days, I would bring my notecards to Dundonald Park. It was there that I first encountered tai chi.\nMen and women would gather, in loose formation, and begin to move with slow thoughtful deliberation, in unison. Their actions combined to achieve a meditative dance, and it soothed me just to watch. There was a beauty and grace to their sessions that resembled a time-lapse video of a water lily opening.\nTai chi was mesmerizing but I couldn't see its point. I could achieve my fitness goals from exercise classes, swimming and cycling-and it didn't seem that moving so slowly would do much to tone muscle, my Jane Fonda-inspired objective for all activity. I chose only to admire this martial art as it was practiced by others, and kept my distance.\nBut tai chi stayed with me-a seed planted. And amazingly, decades later, the necessary conditions for flowering have emerged. More time-thanks to retirement-coupled with a recommendation from my doctor have brought me full circle, only this time I am not on the park bench watching, but inside the formation, literally stumbling toward growth.\nI had some false starts at the outset. The first group I joined was led by a caring instructor, but its late afternoon timing and its setting-a windowless church basement-left me uninspired. After learning the first eight steps, I took a break and never returned. The second try, six months later, was more successful. I found a morning class in a much brighter space-and the tiny seedling began to push through the soil.\nNaively, I had thought that my goal would be to master the choreography of the 108 movements that form the basis of tai chi. Technically right, but wrong on so many counts. Rather, I quickly learned, what required mastering were my own personality traits.\nThe class was full of lovely people who glided effortlessly, seemingly never confused about where to move next or what the names of the moves were. They assured me that they had been beginners once too, and that I would be able to remember all the moves within three or four years. Three to four years! Graduate degrees took less time.\nBut I could see they were right. After six months, I still found it difficult to complete even the opening 13 moves on my own. I could only watch and copy, watch and copy-waiting for the day that my own body would memorize the internal rhythms of the set.\nThe patience needed for such slow progress was so antithetical to the way I normally approached physical activity that I found it almost unbearable. Previously, any sport that I couldn't do easily, I just rejected. I never did learn how to throw a softball or catch it, or how to do the front crawl. I stuck to activities that needed no honing.\nI also needed to lose the excuses, my favourite strategy for avoidance. Declaring natural clumsiness or bad hips or that I still can't tell left from right instinctively (all true, by the way) just wouldn't fly. Commit and improve: That was the only mantra available.\nOh, and one more thing: I needed to listen-another skill where I lacked proficiency. This realization came to me powerfully in my first master class. I had travelled to a tai chi centre for a two-hour session with a well-known instructor. I was excited and nervous. There were people from all over Canada, and I was a newbie compared to almost everyone there. We began with foundation exercises, and almost immediately, the teacher singled me out for instruction.\nTo be singled out is an honour, but I was mortified. As is required, all the others in the class stopped and turned to watch me (so that they could learn, too) while the instructor corrected my positioning. \"Don't lean back,\" he said, and I repeated the movement. \"Still leaning back,\" he observed laconically, and on it went-probably only for a few minutes, but it seemed an eternity.\nI couldn't say, \"Yeah, I get it.\" I had to show that I did. In those seconds, I concentrated as I had never done before, listening intently to what the instructor was saying, watching his movement and then willing my body to move in imitation. I was simultaneously unlearning and learning, crowding out any self consciousness to focus. As I corrected, my emotion shifted from humiliation to exhilaration.

THERE is something about wine experts that rubs people the wrong way. Wine tasting has become the epitome of a privileged elite who spend their days nose deep in a glass of swirling pinot noir. This negative view of wine experts isn't only misguided, but part of a general devaluation of our sense of smell.\nOver 2000 years ago, Aristotle wrote that \"our sense of smell is not accurate but worse than many animals. For man smells poorly.\" The human ability to smell is still thought of as weak. A UK survey showed it was seen as the least important of the senses, and about half of young adults would rather lose their sense of smell than their mobile phones.\nBut humans are astute smellers, and smells affect our lives in profound ways. A decade ago, researchers discovered that humans can often detect odour molecules at a weaker concentration than non-human animals can, outperforming bats, monkeys, pigs, rats and otters-really most other animals except dogs. Ethyl mercaptan, a molecule added to natural gas so we can detect leaks, requires the equivalent of three drops in a space the size of an Olympic swimming pool for us to detect it-a concentration of 0.2 parts per billion.\nIt is true that our sense of smell is different from our other senses. While our brains are superb at performing visual analyses of the sensory environment, the human sense of smell creates holistic impressions of our surroundings, informed by all our senses. When we perceive a smell, we interpret it based also on what we see, hear, think and feel. For example, a bright yellow colour helps bring out the citrus aroma in a lemonade. Hunger or the bodily memory of an illness might create opposite reactions to the same food smell.\nThese cross-sensory influences on our smell perceptions might seem like a shortcoming, but my research has taught me to consider it as a feature, not a bug. My team recently discovered that the brain is especially engaged in making predictions about future smells, and when those predictions are violated by a surprising smell, several regions across the brain respond in an effort to re-evaluate what we are actually smelling.\nWine experts are great at making smell predictions. A pale ruby-red colour might guide the expert to sniff for strawberry and mushroom, characteristic notes of a pinot noir. The sense of smell evolved in natural environments where the senses had to work together to find potential food sources and remember the consequences of eating them.\nThe expertise of wine tasters is fueled by their knowledge of sensory correspondences. Smells bind together impressions from all the senses, linking them to our internal states: hunger, emotions, memories of the past and expectations of the future. That is why anosmia, the loss of the ability to smell, which happened to millions during the covid-19 pandemic, often leaves people depressed, emotionally and sexually disconnected from their partners, with a disrupted appetite and a lack of enjoyment from eating and drinking. They sometimes feel like they are detached from reality rather than being immersed in it.\nSmelling makes us live our life more vividly, and for those affected by chronic anosmia, a cure for the condition cannot come soon enough. While exposure-based smell training remains a recommended treatment, drugs that help rebuild olfactory cells are currently being explored. For those of us who are fortunate to have retained our sense of smell, learning about wines and new cuisines to expand our palate, and spending more time among the smells of nature, are excellent ways to cultivate our nasal intelligence.\n请你回答第30. What does the passage focus on? ( )小题\n   - A. The significance of researching the sense of smell.\n   - B. How the sense of smell functions by involving other senses.\n   - C. The human sense of smell is more accurate than other animals.\n   - D. How can we retrained our sense of smell?",

                "content": "The shape of a life\nAsk most people what 'the good life' involves, and they will likely rattle off a list of goods. Maybe those goods are simple pleasures like food, laughter, sex, or money; maybe they're more refined goods like art, music, friendship, parenthood, or a fulfilling career. Philosophers, you may be surprised to learn, are people too, and often put together similar lists as constituents of the good life. Even Aristotle, who believed that the key to eudaimonia, or 'flourishing', is the cultivation and exercise of virtue, still thought certain goods were either prerequisites for happiness (e.g., health) or goods that came to the virtuous (fame, wealth, friendship).\nIf we're comparing how happy or flourishing various people's lives are, it seems natural to look for certain goods, and compare who has more of them. There are plenty of different ways we could do this, of course, and it's quite likely we won't agree on which goods are the ones that are constitutive of happiness. It may, for one thing, depend on who you are, and what you happen to value. Ask a young actor, for instance, what they'd consider a flourishing, fulfilling life to consist of, and they might reel off a list of goods related to their profession: being cast in high-profile roles, being well-paid, achieving critical acclaim, winning awards, and so on. That seems reasonable enough. An actor's life will be better, all things considered, if it contains these things than if it doesn't.\nBut consider this thought experiment, adapted from one given by the philosopher Dale Dorsey. Let's compare two thespian lives, each seemingly containing the same overall amount of goods, but with very different life-trajectories. First, meet Toby. Toby wants to be an actor. He struggles to get work for many years, enduring all sorts of setbacks and heartbreaks. But as the years go by, Toby manages to land a succession of increasingly prestigious roles. From humble beginnings, he works his way up to become a famous, wealthy, and universally respected actor. His lifetime earnings are $20 million, and he wins an Oscar for his final movie before retiring.\nNow, meet Ybot. Ybot, like Toby, wants to be an actor. Unlike Toby, however, Ybot hits the big time right out of the gate: in fact, he wins an Oscar for his very first film role, making him rich and respected. After this initial easy success, he enjoys a succession of film roles, but over time the roles become less prestigious and less well paid, and he begins to endure a number of setbacks and heartbreaks. Towards the end of his career (across which he has earned $20 million, mostly at the start), he struggles to get work, and finally retires into humble obscurity.\nAs you'll have quickly realized, these two actors' lives, like their names, are mirror-images. Both Toby and Ybot's lives contain the same putative goods: an Oscar, $20 million, fame, respect, and so on. They also contain the same struggles and heartbreaks. If we view their lives as sort of balance sheet of experiential profit and loss, Toby and Ybot both seem to lead lives of equal net worth. The only difference is that Ybot experiences these goods and bads in a reverse order to Toby. Toby's overall 'score' in life slopes upwards over time from a low starting point, while Ybot's slopes downward from an initial high, yet they both hit the same heights and endure the same lows. If flourishing is just a matter of enjoying certain goods, then it seems both actors flourish to the same extent.\nYet most of us, I suspect, would think that the ordering of these goods does, in fact, make a decisive difference to how we compare Toby and Ybot's careers. It seems hard to avoid the conclusion that Toby's life is better than Ybot's. If we had to choose between these lives, most of us would much prefer to live like Toby than Ybot. Both experience triumph and adversity, but Toby's story is one of triumph over adversity, while Ybot's is a story of decline into adversity.\nBut why should that make a difference, if both lives contain the same amount of pleasure vs suffering and both contain the same net benefits? Does our preference for one life over the other track some deep fact about human value, or is it simply an irrational habit of thought—and would we, then, be better off if we ditched this preference?\nWhen comparing the overall welfare level of different lives, it seems natural enough to think of a person's life as a sort of container for various good and bad experiences. Someone whose life contains loving relationships, a stable home life, fulfilling work and experiences like travel and education seems better off than someone whose life does not contain these goods. The goods and the bads are what we evaluate: the 'container' they sit in is basically neutral. But that balance sheet model seems to miss another, more elusive kind of value.\nWe might, for instance, value things like overcoming adversity, or not having our successes come too easily. Someone who climbs a mountain will experience more struggle than someone who gets dropped on the peak by helicopter, but the climber will also have a sense of accomplishment the other person may well envy. In that sense, we might think Toby's life is better because his highs seem more well-earned than Ybot's do. But that's not the whole story. The narrative trajectory itself seems to make a difference. A life of early success followed by stagnation and decline seems like a less overall successful life than one where success comes later in the day. Where the story ends, relative to where it began, seems to matter in itself.\nThis intuitive judgment finds expression in what's been called the 'shape of life' hypothesis. On this view, living a good life is not simply about having the right kind of experiences or life-events, but of having them in the right order or sequence. In other words, it's not enough to have the right ingredients—you have to arrange them in the right sort of way, and some arrangements are better than others, in ways that can't be reduced to the sum of the parts. It's like furniture: you can have two nice sofas and a coffee table, but it also matters how the room is set up.\nWhat the shape of life hypothesis suggests is that our lives are not simply bags into which we cram good things and bad things. The type of life it is—the genre of that life-story, so to speak—matters too. Without the right shape, even a life full of wondrous things can end up as a tale we'd prefer not to live out.\n请你回答第31.

Even Aristotle, who believed that the key to eudaimonia, or 'flourishing', is the cultivation and exercise of virtue, still thought certain goods were either prerequisites for happiness (e.g., health) or goods that came to the virtuous (fame, wealth, friendship).\nIf we're comparing how happy or flourishing various people's lives are, it seems natural to look for certain goods, and compare who has more of them. There are plenty of different ways we could do this, of course, and it's quite likely we won't agree on which goods are the ones that are constitutive of happiness. It may, for one thing, depend on who you are, and what you happen to value. Ask a young actor, for instance, what they'd consider a flourishing, fulfilling life to consist of, and they might reel off a list of goods related to their profession: being cast in high-profile roles, being well-paid, achieving critical acclaim, winning awards, and so on. That seems reasonable enough. An actor's life will be better, all things considered, if it contains these things than if it doesn't.\nBut consider this thought experiment, adapted from one given by the philosopher Dale Dorsey. Let's compare two thespian lives, each seemingly containing the same overall amount of goods, but with very different life-trajectories. First, meet Toby. Toby wants to be an actor. He struggles to get work for many years, enduring all sorts of setbacks and heartbreaks. But as the years go by, Toby manages to land a succession of increasingly prestigious roles. From humble beginnings, he works his way up to become a famous, wealthy, and universally respected actor. His lifetime earnings are $20 million, and he wins an Oscar for his final movie before retiring.\nNow, meet Ybot. Ybot, like Toby, wants to be an actor. Unlike Toby, however, Ybot hits the big time right out of the gate: in fact, he wins an Oscar for his very first film role, making him rich and respected. After this initial easy success, he enjoys a succession of film roles, but over time the roles become less prestigious and less well paid, and he begins to endure a number of setbacks and heartbreaks. Towards the end of his career (across which he has earned $20 million, mostly at the start), he struggles to get work, and finally retires into humble obscurity.\nAs you'll have quickly realized, these two actors' lives, like their names, are mirror-images. Both Toby and Ybot's lives contain the same putative goods: an Oscar, $20 million, fame, respect, and so on. They also contain the same struggles and heartbreaks. If we view their lives as sort of balance sheet of experiential profit and loss, Toby and Ybot both seem to lead lives of equal net worth. The only difference is that Ybot experiences these goods and bads in a reverse order to Toby. Toby's overall 'score' in life slopes upwards over time from a low starting point, while Ybot's slopes downward from an initial high, yet they both hit the same heights and endure the same lows. If flourishing is just a matter of enjoying certain goods, then it seems both actors flourish to the same extent.\nYet most of us, I suspect, would think that the ordering of these goods does, in fact, make a decisive difference to how we compare Toby and Ybot's careers. It seems hard to avoid the conclusion that Toby's life is better than Ybot's. If we had to choose between these lives, most of us would much prefer to live like Toby than Ybot. Both experience triumph and adversity, but Toby's story is one of triumph over adversity, while Ybot's is a story of decline into adversity.\nBut why should that make a difference, if both lives contain the same amount of pleasure vs suffering and both contain the same net benefits? Does our preference for one life over the other track some deep fact about human value, or is it simply an irrational habit of thought—and would we, then, be better off if we ditched this preference?\nWhen comparing the overall welfare level of different lives, it seems natural enough to think of a person's life as a sort of container for various good and bad experiences. Someone whose life contains loving relationships, a stable home life, fulfilling work and experiences like travel and education seems better off than someone whose life does not contain these goods. The goods and the bads are what we evaluate: the 'container' they sit in is basically neutral. But that balance sheet model seems to miss another, more elusive kind of value.\nWe might, for instance, value things like overcoming adversity, or not having our successes come too easily. Someone who climbs a mountain will experience more struggle than someone who gets dropped on the peak by helicopter, but the climber will also have a sense of accomplishment the other person may well envy. In that sense, we might think Toby's life is better because his highs seem more well-earned than Ybot's do. But that's not the whole story. The narrative trajectory itself seems to make a difference. A life of early success followed by stagnation and decline seems like a less overall successful life than one where success comes later in the day. Where the story ends, relative to where it began, seems to matter in itself.\nThis intuitive judgment finds expression in what's been called the 'shape of life' hypothesis. On this view, living a good life is not simply about having the right kind of experiences or life-events, but of having them in the right order or sequence. In other words, it's not enough to have the right ingredients—you have to arrange them in the right sort of way, and some arrangements are better than others, in ways that can't be reduced to the sum of the parts. It's like furniture: you can have two nice sofas and a coffee table, but it also matters how the room is set up.\nWhat the shape of life hypothesis suggests is that our lives are not simply bags into which we cram good things and bad things. The type of life it is—the genre of that life-story, so to speak—matters too. Without the right shape, even a life full of wondrous things can end up as a tale we'd prefer not to live out.\n请你回答第33.

            "original_question": "The shape of a life\nAsk most people what 'the good life' involves, and they will likely rattle off a list of goods. Maybe those goods are simple pleasures like food, laughter, sex, or money; maybe they're more refined goods like art, music, friendship, parenthood, or a fulfilling career. Philosophers, you may be surprised to learn, are people too, and often put together similar lists as constituents of the good life. Even Aristotle, who believed that the key to eudaimonia, or 'flourishing', is the cultivation and exercise of virtue, still thought certain goods were either prerequisites for happiness (e.g., health) or goods that came to the virtuous (fame, wealth, friendship).\nIf we're comparing how happy or flourishing various people's lives are, it seems natural to look for certain goods, and compare who has more of them. There are plenty of different ways we could do this, of course, and it's quite likely we won't agree on which goods are the ones that are constitutive of happiness. It may, for one thing, depend on who you are, and what you happen to value. Ask a young actor, for instance, what they'd consider a flourishing, fulfilling life to consist of, and they might reel off a list of goods related to their profession: being cast in high-profile roles, being well-paid, achieving critical acclaim, winning awards, and so on. That seems reasonable enough. An actor's life will be better, all things considered, if it contains these things than if it doesn't.\nBut consider this thought experiment, adapted from one given by the philosopher Dale Dorsey. Let's compare two thespian lives, each seemingly containing the same overall amount of goods, but with very different life-trajectories. First, meet Toby. Toby wants to be an actor. He struggles to get work for many years, enduring all sorts of setbacks and heartbreaks. But as the years go by, Toby manages to land a succession of increasingly prestigious roles. From humble beginnings, he works his way up to become a famous, wealthy, and universally respected actor. His lifetime earnings are $20 million, and he wins an Oscar for his final movie before retiring.\nNow, meet Ybot. Ybot, like Toby, wants to be an actor. Unlike Toby, however, Ybot hits the big time right out of the gate: in fact, he wins an Oscar for his very first film role, making him rich and respected. After this initial easy success, he enjoys a succession of film roles, but over time the roles become less prestigious and less well paid, and he begins to endure a number of setbacks and heartbreaks. Towards the end of his career (across which he has earned $20 million, mostly at the start), he struggles to get work, and finally retires into humble obscurity.\nAs you'll have quickly realized, these two actors' lives, like their names, are mirror-images. Both Toby and Ybot's lives contain the same putative goods: an Oscar, $20 million, fame, respect, and so on. They also contain the same struggles and heartbreaks. If we view their lives as sort of balance sheet of experiential profit and loss, Toby and Ybot both seem to lead lives of equal net worth. The only difference is that Ybot experiences these goods and bads in a reverse order to Toby. Toby's overall 'score' in life slopes upwards over time from a low starting point, while Ybot's slopes downward from an initial high, yet they both hit the same heights and endure the same lows. If flourishing is just a matter of enjoying certain goods, then it seems both actors flourish to the same extent.\nYet most of us, I suspect, would think that the ordering of these goods does, in fact, make a decisive difference to how we compare Toby and Ybot's careers. It seems hard to avoid the conclusion that Toby's life is better than Ybot's. If we had to choose between these lives, most of us would much prefer to live like Toby than Ybot. Both experience triumph and adversity, but Toby's story is one of triumph over adversity, while Ybot's is a story of decline into adversity.\nBut why should that make a difference, if both lives contain the same amount of pleasure vs suffering and both contain the same net benefits? Does our preference for one life over the other track some deep fact about human value, or is it simply an irrational habit of thought—and would we, then, be better off if we ditched this preference?\nWhen comparing the overall welfare level of different lives, it seems natural enough to think of a person's life as a sort of container for various good and bad experiences. Someone whose life contains loving relationships, a stable home life, fulfilling work and experiences like travel and education seems better off than someone whose life does not contain these goods. The goods and the bads are what we evaluate: the 'container' they sit in is basically neutral. But that balance sheet model seems to miss another, more elusive kind of value.\nWe might, for instance, value things like overcoming adversity, or not having our successes come too easily. Someone who climbs a mountain will experience more struggle than someone who gets dropped on the peak by helicopter, but the climber will also have a sense of accomplishment the other person may well envy. In that sense, we might think Toby's life is better because his highs seem more well-earned than Ybot's do. But that's not the whole story. The narrative trajectory itself seems to make a difference. A life of early success followed by stagnation and decline seems like a less overall successful life than one where success comes later in the day. Where the story ends, relative to where it began, seems to matter in itself.\nThis intuitive judgment finds expression in what's been called the 'shape of life' hypothesis. On this view, living a good life is not simply about having the right kind of experiences or life-events, but of having them in the right order or sequence.

They also hope that such robots can aid doctors in operations and then safely break down inside the body.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the technology is still in very early stages. \"If we truly want to have a biodegradable robot,\" Hartmann says, \"we also need to make sure its electronics and power parts are biodegradable.\"\n请你回答第What can we learn from the passage?小题\n   - A. Soft robots are widely used to clean up e-waste.\n   - B. Soft robots have to rest for a week after heavy use.\n   - C. The designing of soft robots borrows ideas from nature.\n   - D. Mechanical engineering offers new ways to run soft robots.",

In the same year, he visited Yunnan, bought nearly two tons, and began to sell 'Yunnan Tuocha' in Europe. Since 1986, Yunnan's Pu'er tuocha has got many prizes at food expos (博览会) in France, America and other countries. Today you can see an old Australian lady holding a cup of tea of sun-dried Pu'er, though she still enjoys her English-style black tea with milk and sugar.

            "original_question": "Tea has long been a popular drink in China. Chinese people love different kinds of tea. Among them, black tea and white tea from Fujian, green tea from Zhejiang and Anhui, and dark tea from Yunnan are some of the favorites. In the Song Dynasty (960-1279), tea culture reached new heights. The beauty of the Song tea came alive through 'dian cha'. Powdered (粉状的) tea was whisked (搅打) with water into soft 'clouds'. White tea was often used to make the 'clouds' as white as the moonlight. Tea artists used clean water to draw pictures on them with a teaspoon. The way of serving dian cha became a living art. It later influenced Japanese tea culture. Today, more young people are learning and passing it on. Yunnan's dark tea, especially Pu'er, got famous because of the Ancient Tea Horse Road. And it won popularity around the world. In 1976, Frenchman Fred Kempler found a new kind of Pu'er from Yunnan in a Hong Kong shop. In the same year, he visited Yunnan, bought nearly two tons, and began to sell 'Yunnan Tuocha' in Europe. Since 1986, Yunnan's Pu'er tuocha has got many prizes at food expos (博览会) in France, America and other countries. Today you can see an old Australian lady holding a cup of tea of sun-dried Pu'er, though she still enjoys her English-style black tea with milk and sugar. Tea is a bridge of friendship among nations and peoples. Tea is enjoyed timelessly from ancient to modern times. Each cup of dian cha, white as the moonlight, turned tea into art, and art into eternity (永恒). Tea is also loved globally from the east to the west. Each cup of Pu'er, with the smell of sunshine, turns tea into friendship, and friendship into a shared future.\n请你回答第When did Fred Kempler begin to sell 'Yunnan Tuocha' in Europe?小题\n   - A.

                "content": "Sunshine does make people happier. Imagine how cheerful you are when it clears up after long cold rainy days. Let’s discover science behind sunlight.\nSunlight causes you to produce a chemical (化学物质) called serotonin (血清素). When you are exposed to sunlight, your body will make more serotonin. Higher levels of serotonin will keep you in good spirits. At night, when there is little or no light, your body produces another chemical—melatonin (褪黑激素). It helps your body relax and will make you feel tired, which can prepare you for a good night’s sleep. You should keep a good balance between these two chemicals.\nHowever, for many people, it is hard to balance sunlight with darkness. People who stay indoors a lot may not get enough sunlight. The light in a house is usually about 100 times less than that outside on a sunny day. That’s why it is believed that those people should get outside in the sunshine. They can get some exercise, enjoy the fresh air and be happy, all at the same time.\nThere are places where it gets dark for a long time in the winter. People in those places are easier to get seasonal affective disorder (SAD). People with SAD usually go through bad experiences such as low energy and sadness. The most common treatment for those people is to sit under bright artificial (人工的) lights for some time.\nThe roles that sunshine plays in people’s life are more than those above. For example, your body produces Vitamin D (维生素D) from sunlight, which is important for being healthy. In fact, there is more science about sunlight for you to discover.

            "original_question": "Sunshine does make people happier. Imagine how cheerful you are when it clears up after long cold rainy days. Let’s discover science behind sunlight.\nSunlight causes you to produce a chemical (化学物质) called serotonin (血清素). When you are exposed to sunlight, your body will make more serotonin. Higher levels of serotonin will keep you in good spirits. At night, when there is little or no light, your body produces another chemical—melatonin (褪黑激素). It helps your body relax and will make you feel tired, which can prepare you for a good night’s sleep. You should keep a good balance between these two chemicals.\nHowever, for many people, it is hard to balance sunlight with darkness. People who stay indoors a lot may not get enough sunlight. The light in a house is usually about 100 times less than that outside on a sunny day. That’s why it is believed that those people should get outside in the sunshine. They can get some exercise, enjoy the fresh air and be happy, all at the same time.\nThere are places where it gets dark for a long time in the winter. People in those places are easier to get seasonal affective disorder (SAD). People with SAD usually go through bad experiences such as low energy and sadness. The most common treatment for those people is to sit under bright artificial (人工的) lights for some time.\nThe roles that sunshine plays in people’s life are more than those above. For example, your body produces Vitamin D (维生素D) from sunlight, which is important for being healthy. In fact, there is more science about sunlight for you to discover. So next time, when you notice the sunshine on your shoulder, take a moment to think, “Why do we love sunshine?”\n\n请你回答第Which of the following is an opinion according to the text?小题\n   - A.

We always looked forward to spending every moment with them, especially Grandpa, the \"hero\" in our eyes.\n\nGrandpa became blind when he was 20 years old, but it never slowed down the strong-willed (坚强) man. He worked in a shop every day. Customers would give him money, and he would return the right change and give them exactly what they wanted. He had many friends who visited the shop just to talk to him, and at that time, I helped to hand customers their drinks and snacks. This made me feel grown-up.\n\nHe also cooked lunch and washed dishes while Grandma worked. As a boy, I would watch him move around the house from room to room as if he could see. I was so surprised about how he moved from cooking to washing the dishes, never making a mistake.\n\nIt seemed like every time I stayed with him, we would visit someone in the evening who was weak or very sick. Although he can't see things, he never let it stop him from working and being kind to others. His love for people never ended.\n\nDuring those weeks, he taught me many lessons that I still treasure today. They take me back to those days and remind me how special he was.
